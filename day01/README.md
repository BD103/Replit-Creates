# Day 1

> "Make the worst website possible"

This is a cool prompt that asks you "what is the worst website possible?" My answer is "no website." Any object is inherently bad at being what it's not.

Since not making a website seems boring, I decided to do the next ~~best~~ worst thing: A porrly designed mash of programming technologies. Hence, using Flask as a static file host.

There are some more "bad" things, but I'll let you find that out.

## Running

Copy all of the files to a new folder, and run the following. (Python must be installed, and the commands are for Unix.)

```shell
$ python -m venv .venv
$ .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can now run the program with:

```shell
$ .venv/bin/flask run
```

If you are on Replit, you can just click the run button.

## Notes

One intentional feature I added was "index" being spelled wrong. What looks like an "I" on most machines is actually a lowercase "L"! I thought it would be funny for the person to immediately land on a 404. There are some other things too, so I recommend checking out the actual code.

See you tomorrow!
