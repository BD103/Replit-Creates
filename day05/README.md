# Day 5

> "Make something random"

Today, instead of making something random, I instead created the tools to find some things that are random.

Welcome to Find Something Random, a NuxtJS + TailwindCSS website that showcases a bunch of the amazing repls created for week 1 of [Replit Creates](https://creates.replit.com). While these certainly aren't all of the great repls, they are a few. A random repl is selected each time you refresh the website.

## Thoughts on Nuxt and Vue

This is the second project I've ever made with NuxtJS / VueJS, and the first that I've ever completed. Overall, I'm quite impressed. Though I don't like Javascript as a language, I do appreciate the power of Vue templates, TailwindCSS's easy design, and Node's portability.

While I probably would have rather made this is Rust, it wouldn't have fit. Rust is made for systems programming, while JS is designed for the web.

Either way, this concludes week 1 of Replit Creates. I'm very happy with what I've done so far, and plan on finishing / rewriting Day 3 over the weekend. There was also a show-and-tell livestream today, which was quite epic. I've struggled in the past showcasing my code. Today was different, and I got a lot of great feedback because of it. This has encouraged me to continue with Replit Creates, and continue to interact with the Replit community.

I'm having a lot of fun! See you next monday,
