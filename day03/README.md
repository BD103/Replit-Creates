# Day 3

> "Write a story"

This is my unfinished attempt at animating a poem in the terminal. The poem would be "Aquainted with the Night" by Robert Frost. (See "original.txt".) I was really busy today, and didn't have time to start working on it until 7:00 PM. I was fiddling around with ideas all day, and just then figured out what to do.

Sadly the 3 hours 30 minutes that I spent on it wasn't enough. I'm going to commit this now, but not submit it on Replit. While the code framework works, I didn't have time to actually create the product. If late submissions are allowed, and I finish tomorrow's challenge, then I may return to this.

This is a good learning experience to not underestimate the amount of time coding takes. As a move forward in the month, I will need a game-plan to code around my schedule.

Either way, I'm going to sleep now. Good night ðŸ¥±,
