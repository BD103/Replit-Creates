# Day 3

> "Write a story"

This project was crazy to work on. I spent (a lot) more time on it than I should've, and am now a few days behind in Replit Creates. Anyways...

This website is a book suggestor. It asks you a few questions, then runs all of the books through a hit/misses algorithm based on your query. If you would rather browse all of the books, there is a library for that. With each book, I've included metadata and a review about them. I have personally read each book that gets suggested, and vouch for them accordingly.

> **Note:** I love fantasy books, so you're more likely to find those in your search.

## Development Process

This is my second attempt at Day 3's prompt. The first time I was really busy, so I didn't have time to finish it. You can see my first attempt [here](https://github.com/BD103/Replit-Creates/tree/791364ce0a627698e18d49baccffdf69846ffefd/day03). Over the weekend, I decided to scrap that attempt for a book suggestor instead.

This is the second NuxtJS / Vue project that I've posted to Replit Creates. Some differences are that it has multiple pages, is written (mostly) TypeScript, and uses WindiCSS. (WindiCSS has built-in support for Nuxt 3, which is what I needed.)

Writing this website was a rollercoasting, but I am pleased with the visual asthetic and design.

> **Self-Promotion:** If you enjoy playing / using my projects, you should consider follow me on [Replit](https://replit.com/@BD103) and [Github](https://github.com/BD103). I'm an active programmer, and plan on posting a project for each day of Replit Creates. Thank you for the support!

Since I'm now finished with Day 3, I need to get working on Days 6 and 7. See you soon!
